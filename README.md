I - Introduction

School project. This was one of the coolest project I've done, firstly because it was technically the first game I made and secondly because it was the only project that impressed my parents when I showed them (they do not understand tech stuff) : 

"This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game : Wolfenstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. 
Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way. "
